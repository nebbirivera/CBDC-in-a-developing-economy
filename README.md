Stochastic General Equilibrium Analysis*".

The file `main.m` runs the subroutines that generate the plots and results shown
in the paper. This file executes two main subroutines: 

- `business_cycle_analysis` that solves the model using the perturbations methods implemented in Dynare to analize its business cycle behavior;

- `sacrifice_ratios` performs couterfactual numerical experiments to measure 
monetary policy sacrifice ratios under different parametrizations of the CBDC.

The entirety of the code and the document was written by the authors.
